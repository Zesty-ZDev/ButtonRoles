## FAQ


#### What is "color" in the config.json?

This sets the color of all the embeds the bot will send including the "Verify" button embed and the staff request embeds, this value has to be a color hex for example "#9aaae3"

#### Why am I getting permission errors?

You are likely receiving these errors because the bot does not have the permission to give roles or the role it is trying to give it above the bot itself thus it cannot give this role
